    <h2>An Introduction</h2>
    <p class="box">Yo I'm Gabe aka aDinguss! I'm an artist, aspiring game designer, and overall creative. While I have yet to release a full game myself, I spend a lot of my freetime working on game concepts, and in addition, I have also created a webcomic on WEBTOON. Needless to say, I like to make things.</p>
    <h2>Game Opinions</h2>
    <h3>What I Look for in a Video Game</h3>
    <p class="box">For me, I like a game that has near endless replay value or customization. The more opportunities for freedom in how I choose to play, the more likely I am to enjoy the game, and keep coming back to it. Additionally, having multiplayer and being fun to play with my friends is another huge bonus.</p>
    <h3>Types of Games I Really Like</h3>
    <h4>Roguelikes</h4>
    <h4>Card Games/TCGs</h4>
    <h4>RPGs</h4>
