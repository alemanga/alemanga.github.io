            <p class="introbody">Yo I'm Gabe aka aDinguss! I'm an artist, aspiring game designer, and overall creative. While I have yet to release a full game myself, I spend a lot of my freetime working on game concepts, and I have also created a webcomic on WEBTOON. Needless to say, I like to make things.</p>

            <p class="gamesbody">For me, I like a game that has near endless replay value or customization. The more opportunities for freedom in how I choose to play, the more likely I am to enjoy the game, and keep coming back to it. Additionally, having multiplayer and being fun to play with my friends is another huge bonus.</p>
