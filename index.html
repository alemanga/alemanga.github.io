            <p class="introbody">Yo I'm Gabe aka aDinguss! I'm an artist, aspiring game designer, and overall creative. While I have yet to release a full game myself, I spend a lot of my freetime working on game concepts, and I have also created a webcomic on WEBTOON. Needless to say, I like to make things.</p>

        <h3 class="gamesheader">Games I Wanna Make</h3>
        <div class="gamesbodybox">
            <p class="gamesbody">I’ve always liked games that have near endless replay value or customization. The more opportunities for freedom in how I choose to play, the more likely I am to enjoy the game, and keep coming back to it. Ultimately, I just want the games I make to be <b>fun</b>, first and foremost.</p>
            <p class="gamesbody">It’s for these reasons that some of my favorite genres of games are Roguelikes, RPGs, Platformers, and Card Games, and as such, these are the types of games that I would like to make. I find myself inspired by developers like Edmund McMillen, Toby Fox, and studios like The Behemoth.</p>

            <p class="favgamesbody">The following is a selection of my current favorite games right now. This doesn’t necessarily mean they are my favorite video games of all time, or that they even crack my top ten. These are just some games that I’ve either been playing a lot of or have been inspired by recently.</p>
