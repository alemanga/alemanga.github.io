        <p class="introBodytext">Yo I'm Gabe aka aDinguss! I'm an artist, aspiring game designer, and overall creative. While I have yet to release a full game myself, I spend a lot of my freetime working on game concepts, and in addition, I have also created a webcomic on WEBTOON. Needless to say, I like to make things.</p>

        <h2 class="gamesHead">Thoughts on Games</h2>
        <p class="webcomicBodytext">For me, I like a game that has near endless replay value or customization. The more opportunities for freedom in how I choose to play, the more likely I am to enjoy the game, and keep coming back to it. Additionally, having multiplayer and being fun to play with my friends is another huge bonus.</p>
